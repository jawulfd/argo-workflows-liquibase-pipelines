# Argo Workflows Liquibase Pipelines

The main purpose of this repository is to integrate [liquibase tool](https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html) 
with argo events and workflows, and to provide an initial implementation of this integration 
that can be evolved to adapt to different contexts

### Pre-Requisites

The implemented Argo Events and Workflows have been developed using the following configurations:

- Kubernetes v1.30.4
- Argo Workflows Helm Chart 0.45.1, which points to argo workflows version v3.6.2
- Argo Events Helm Chart 2.4.9, which points to argo events version 1.9.3

### Configuration Resources

In the folder [resources](resources), the different service accounts and secrets which have been configured during the
implementation process can be found

### Argo Workflows

In the folder [resources](resources)[templates](templates), the different workflow templates definitions for liquibase commands
can be found and the workflows which reference previous templates are located in [workflows](workflows) folder

### Argo Events Configuration

In the folder [events](events), the different configurations for EventBus, EventSource and Sensor can be found

### Developing Environment

In order to be able to trigger argo events from local environment without exposing your local environment to public internet,
[cloudflared quick tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/)
can be used to generate a dynamic dns to connect the service generated by event source to GitHub Webhooks
